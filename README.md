## How It Works

The WeatherAPI Weather Application makes HTTP requests to the WeatherAPI to retrieve weather data. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **HTTP Request**: The application sends an HTTPS request to the WeatherAPI, providing the location (e.g., city) and API key.

```js
https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/astronomy.xml?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={CITY}
```

2. **XML Return**: The WeatherAPI responds with XML data containing various weather-related information, including location details, astronomy data (e.g., sunrise and sunset times), and more.
```xml
<root>
<location>
<name>London</name>
<region>City of London, Greater London</region>
<country>United Kingdom</country>
<lat>51.52</lat>
<lon>-0.11</lon>
<tz_id>Europe/London</tz_id>
<localtime_epoch>1695509046</localtime_epoch>
<localtime>2023-09-23 23:44</localtime>
</location>
<astronomy>
<astro>
<sunrise>06:47 AM</sunrise>
<sunset>06:57 PM</sunset>
<moonrise>04:31 PM</moonrise>
<moonset>11:11 PM</moonset>
<moon_phase>Waxing Gibbous</moon_phase>
<moon_illumination>52</moon_illumination>
<is_moon_up>0</is_moon_up>
<is_sun_up>0</is_sun_up>
</astro>
</astronomy>
</root>
```
